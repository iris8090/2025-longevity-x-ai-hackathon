## üß≠ Description

This dataset contains single-nucleus transcriptomes from human skeletal muscle samples spanning young and aged adult individuals. The goal was to understand the molecular changes in muscle cells associated with aging.

Each sample is represented by a `.h5` file in the original dataset, which we have converted into a unified sparse expression matrix and metadata file for easy access and analysis.
